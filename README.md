# POLY_PIPELINE

> A data analysis pipeline for STOmics data for polyploid organisms.

---

## 📘 Overview

**POLY_PIPELINE** is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to process and analyze STOmics data specifically tailored to **polyploid** organisms. It automates and simplifies several steps of spatial transcriptomics data analysis, ensuring reproducibility, flexibility, and scalability for large, complex genomes.

This pipeline aims to help researchers in the fields of genomics, spatial biology, and plant sciences extract meaningful insights from high-throughput STOmics experiments.
